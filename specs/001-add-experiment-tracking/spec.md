# Feature Specification: Experiment Tracking and Baseline Comparison

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-experiment-tracking`  
**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add experiment tracking with MLflow or structured comparison of baseline fits
Add MLflow to requirements.txt.
Import and initialize MLflow in api/model.py.
Wrap each asset/model fit in an MLflow run within api/model.py.
Log model parameters, metrics, and artifacts (plots, .pkl, .csv) to MLflow in api/model.py.
Create a summary table or dashboard for structured comparison of baseline fits.
Document the experiment tracking workflow."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A data scientist or analyst wants to track, compare, and document the results of model fitting experiments for different assets. They need to log parameters, metrics, and artifacts for each fit, and later review a summary or dashboard comparing baseline fits.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new or updated model fit, **When** the experiment is run, **Then** the system logs parameters, metrics, and artifacts for that run.
2. **Given** multiple baseline fits, **When** the user reviews results, **Then** the system presents a summary table or dashboard for structured comparison.
3. **Given** the experiment tracking workflow, **When** a new team member joins, **Then** they can follow documented steps to track and compare experiments.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if MLflow is unavailable or fails to log an experiment? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the system retry, warn, or fail gracefully?]
- How does the system handle very large artifacts (e.g., large .pkl or .csv files)?
- What if two experiments are run in parallel for the same asset?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to track model fitting experiments for each asset.
- **FR-002**: System MUST log model parameters, metrics, and artifacts (plots, .pkl, .csv) for each experiment.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a summary table or dashboard for structured comparison of baseline fits.
- **FR-004**: System MUST document the experiment tracking workflow for team onboarding and reproducibility.
- **FR-005**: System MUST add MLflow as a dependency.
- **FR-006**: System MUST import and initialize MLflow in the model fitting workflow.
- **FR-007**: System MUST wrap each asset/model fit in an MLflow run.
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle experiment logging failures gracefully. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Define expected behavior on MLflow failure.]
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure experiment tracking does not significantly degrade model fitting performance. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the acceptable performance overhead?]

### Key Entities
- **Experiment Run**: Represents a single model fit, with parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
- **Asset**: The subject of the model fit (e.g., a machine or component).
- **Summary Table/Dashboard**: Aggregates and compares results from multiple experiment runs.
